xobox Documentation
===================

This documentation covers both, usage and development of xobox. Please read the appropriate sections carefully before
raising an issue or ask for support otherwise - there's a good chance your question might be answered by the information
provided through this documentation. Please note that though related this documentation does not cover
general `X-Plane`_ or `FSEconomy`_ end user guidance.

.. _FSEconomy: http://www.fseconomy.net/

.. note::

   This documentation is perpetually updated from the project's central :ref:`git repository's <blessed-repository>`
   master branch. To ensure you work with the latest version available, please make sure to access this documentation
   exclusively at https://stormrose.github.io/xobox/


How the documentation is organised
----------------------------------

* If you're an X-Plane user, wishing to use xobox for analysing your recorded flight data (e. g. to create FSEconomy
  relevant profile information), try the :doc:`User's Guide <user/index>`.

* The :doc:`Project Documentation <internals/index>` will tell you about the development process, and how you can
  contribute.

* :doc:`Reference guides <ref/index>` contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of the xobox
  machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a sound understanding of programming
  concepts and profound `Python`_ knowledge.
