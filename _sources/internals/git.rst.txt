Source Code Repository
======================

.. _blessed-repository:

xobox uses `Git`_ for managing source code repositories. The project's "blessed" Git repository (``origin``) resides at
`GitHub`_. It is publicly accessible, but only :ref:`core team members <core-team>` can push into this blessed
repository. :ref:`Developers <developers>` and other contributors are requested to fork the repository into their
personal space and offer code changes as :ref:`pull request <pull-request>`.


Repository Structure
--------------------

.. _protected-branches:

Protected Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The eternal branch, ``master``, is managed as `protected branch`_:

* ``master`` is the main (eternal) branch. It represents the latest state of development.
* direct commits to ``master`` are not permitted, instead, :ref:`pull requests <pull-request>` have to be used

In addition to ``master``, also :ref:`release branches <release-branches>` become protected branches after the
initial version (patch level zero) has been released.


.. _feature-branches:

Feature Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Feature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. When starting
development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that
point. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually
be merged back into ``master``.

.. important::

   Feature branches are not intended to exist in the :ref:`blessed repository <blessed-repository>` itself, but instead
   they should be limited to forks and local clones of the project's `Git`_ repository (``origin``).

* Feature branches must be branched off ``master``
* Feature branches must relate to a GitHub issue
* By convention, their name shall be prefixed with ``feature/`` and the issue ID they refer to
* Feature branches merge back into ``master`` via :ref:`pull request <pull-request>`
* Feature branches are deleted after being merged back into ``master``. They typically exist in developer repos only,
  but not in ``origin``.


.. _release-branches:

Release Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow for last-minute minor bug fixes and
preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.). Beyond preparation, they also serve as
maintenance branches for a release post publication of that release. Once being in maintenance mode, release branches
are managed as :ref:`protected branches <protected-branches>`.

* Release branches must be branched off ``master``
* By convention, their name shall be prefixed with ``release/``, followed by the release's version number
  (``release/<version>``). The version number is a combination of ``major.minor``, without ``patch`` suffix.
* Release branches merge back into ``master`` via :ref:`pull request <pull-request>`. A merge of
  a release branch back into ``master`` absolutely requires a release tag to be set on the head of the release
  branch prior merging.


.. _hotfix-branches:

Hotfix Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hotfix branches are very much like feature branches in that they are also meant to introduce code changes into a
:ref:`protected branch <protected-branches>`, albeit unplanned. They arise from the necessity to act immediately
upon an undesired state of a maintained, published production version. When a critical bug in a production version
must be resolved immediately, a hotfix branch may be branched off from the corresponding release branch that marks the
production version.

* Hotfix branches must be branched off the corresponding release tag on the corresponding release branch
* By convention, their name shall be prefixed with ``hotfix/``, followed by the release's version number and hotfix
  suffix, as well as a reference to the corresponding :ref:`issue <issues>`
  (``hotfix/<version>/<issue id>/<description>``).
* Hotfix branches merge back into the release branch eventually into ``master`` via :ref:`pull request <pull-request>`.
  A merge of a hotfix branch back into ``master`` is only recommended if ``master`` has not evolved/diverged so much
  from the release maintenance branch that the fix hasn't lost its relevance. In such a case, a cherry-pick is
  potentially the right approach instead of a fully-fledged merge.


.. _git-workflow:

Git Workflow
------------

For the xobox project, we chose to follow a dedicated flow for development. The following graph illustrates the flow:

.. image:: ../_static/advanced-git-branching-model.png

The development of a new feature, or the improvement of an existing feature (including bug fixing) always starts with
opening an :doc:`issue <issues>`. Once the issue is created and assigned, a feature branch has to be created, following
this naming convention::

   feature/<class>/<issue id>/<description>

.. note::

   Please note that the branch name must comply with reference name rules (cf. `git check-ref-format`_).

The **Issue ID** is the numerical identifier generated by GitHub, padded to six digits (left padding with ``0``).

The **class** may be one of

* *new* -- for new features
* *imp* -- for optimisation or enhancement
* *doc* -- for documentation only updates
* *pro* -- for project related changes (code reorganization, governance changes, ...)
* *qca* -- for quality control & assurance related changes (policy, code quality, ...)

Do the following in your local copy of your **own fork**:

.. code-block:: bash

   git fetch
   git checkout master
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/new/001234/supergadget master

As soon as the feature branch is created and work has started, the related :ref:`issue status <issue-status>` should be
updated to "in progress".

.. important::

   Do not use issue closing hooks (e. g. ``Fixes #1234``) in your commit messages when committing to the feature branch.
   Closing the issue is reserved for the pull request.

Once the work on the feature branch is done and continuous integration testing shows positive results, a
:ref:`pull request <pull-request>` can be opened to notify the :ref:`core team <core-team>`. The
:ref:`status <issue-status>` of the corresponding issue should be updated to "ready".

In case of acceptance, the pull request is authorised by a core team member, the feature branch gets merged into
``master`` and can then deleted in your fork. The :ref:`issue status <issue-status>` is updated to "Integration", which
means the issue can now be tested in the nightly builds.

.. _pull-request:

Pull Request
------------

`GitHub Pull Requests`_ are used to merge new code from a :ref:`feature branch <feature-branches>` into a
:ref:`protected branch <protected-branches>` or from one protected branch into another.

This section concentrates on pull requests opened by :ref:`developers <developers>` in order to have a feature
branch merged into ``origin/master``. Any other case, where pull requests are used (e. g. cleansing of branches etc.)
are processes solely played within the :ref:`core team <core-team>`.

.. important::

   When opening a pull request from your personal fork, please consider the hints given in
   `Allowing Changes to a Pull Request`_. Otherwise it might be difficult to proceed with the PR.

.. hint::

   Before opening a pull request, please ensure your feature branch is updated (rebased) to the latest ``HEAD`` of
   ``origin/master``, to ensure that only intended code changes become part of your PR.

.. hint::

   You can use a pull request for intermediate reviews with the core team. In that case, keep the
   :ref:`status <issue-status>` of the corresponding issue set to "in progress", prefix the merge
   request title with ``[WIP]`` and do **not** assign the pull request to anyone.

Pull requests may be accepted straight away (mostly in very simple cases, e. g. a simple bug fix) -- although this most
likely will rather be an exception. In such a case, the :ref:`status <issue-status>` of the corresponding issue will be
updated to "Integration" by the core team member who accepted the pull request.

If otherwise the :ref:`core team <core-team>` accepts the pull request for review, they will update the
:ref:`issue status <issue-status>` to "Review" and assign a core team member to the pull request. In this
(much more likely) scenario, the core team member in charge will review the content of the change request and its
implications for the code in ``origin/master`` together with the :ref:`developer <developers>` who opened the pull
request.

.. note::

   Do not abuse pull requests to mature your code. As a general rule, a pull request should only be opened
   if implementation work on the feature branch is completed, and CI testing gives a green status.

In case of obvious immaturity or non-quality, non-compliance with governance and :doc:`coding style <code-style>`, a
pull request may be rejected by the core team. In such a case, the core team member rejecting the pull request shall
write a justification statement (as a comment on the pull request), explaining why this pull request has been
rejected.
