Issue Management
================

Issues are managed centrally via `GitHub Issues`_. For better visualisation, the project uses a
`Kanban Board`_. Three types of labels are used to classify issues.


.. _issue-type:

Type
----

The type label indicates what kind the issue is of. These types are available:

* **bug** marks an error within the source code or the application logic
* **regression** marks an error that was introduced by another fix or feature
* **feature** marks a request for a new feature
* **enhancement** marks a request for enhancing an existing feature
* **optimisation** marks a request for optimising a feature or the corresponding source code
* **quality** marks a request to improve code quality or test coverage
* **doc** marks a request for amending or updating the documentation
* **legal** marks issues related to legal affairs (e. g. licensing, patents, etc.)
* **infrastructure** marks issues related to the project's technical infrastructure
* **project** marks issues related to general project management
* **releng** marks issues related to release management (e. g. version bumps etc.)
* **support** marks requests for technical support


.. _issue-priority:

Priority
--------

The Stormrose Project uses these priority labels to mark issues which require fast attention:

* **security** -- top priority label marking security issues
* **critical** -- non-security related label for top priority issues endangering or blocking production use

Otherwise, priorities are expressed by the sorting order within the respective column of the `Kanban Board`_ -- an
issue placed above another issue within the column has a higher priority than the one placed below.

Priorities may be subject to review by the :ref:`core team <core-team>`. They will adjust proposed priorities if
necessary to the right level.


.. _issue-status:

Status
------

The status of an issue is not managed by a label, but instead by a column on the `Kanban Board`_ the issue is
assigned to.

The xobox project uses these columns (i. e. status messages):

* **Backlog** -- all issues that are waiting to be worked on.
* **In Progress** -- issues that are currently being worked on (i. e. a feature branch exists for these issues).
* **Ready** -- issues whose feature branch is considered ready for merge into the ``origin/master`` branch (i. e. a
  pull request has been created for the respective issue).
* **Review** -- issues which are subject to an extended review by the :ref:`core team <core-team>`, pending validation
  or feedback or whose progress is blocked by whatever reason. Issues with this status are subject to regular reviews
  by the core team members.
* **Rejected** -- issues which have been rejected by the :ref:`core team <core-team>`, usually after a longer review
  period. Issues violating xobox' project objectives or the overall Stormrose policies may be immediately rejected.
* **Done** -- issues that are considered complete after integration test. May be closed after review/confirmation.
