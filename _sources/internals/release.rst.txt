Release Management
==================

.. _version:

Version Scheme
--------------

xobox follows a `semantic`_ version scheme complying with `PEP 440`_. Version indicators are of the form

  ``major.minor[.patch][{a|b|rc|.dev}N]``

with the following meaning of version components:

major
   The major version number, indicating the release family. Changes breaking backwards compatibility shall
   entail an increase of the major version number.

minor
   The minor version number, indicating the version inside a release family. Changes not breaking backwards
   compatibility (e. g. an additional feature or option) shall entail an increase of the minor version number.

patch
   The patch number. By default, all releases start with patch number ``0``. In this case, the patch number is
   omitted from the version information. Patches indicate errata fixes (either concerning security or functionality),
   but are limited to changes not modifying the product functionality or even breaking compatibility.

pre-release suffix (a, b, rc)
   Suffix indicating a pre-release stage of the current version, i. e. "alpha" (indicated by a), "beta" (indicated by
   b) or "release candidate" (indicated by rc) versions. Any pre-release suffix is mandatorily followed by a numeric
   sequence indicator (i. e. a1 = "alpha number one", rc2 = "release candidate number two").

.dev suffix
   The .dev suffix is mutually exclusive to pre-release suffices and indicates a version that is still under
   development. The .dev suffix is always followed by a numeric indicator pointing to the corresponding Git commit.


Internally, version numbers are represented as Python tuple with the following elements:

  ``(major, minor, patch, stage, suffix)``

Major, minor and patch are numeric (non-negative integers) with the same meaning as indicated above.

stage
   is a string, reading either ``alpha``, ``beta``, ``rc``, or ``final``, marking the stage of development.

suffix
   is numeric (non-negative integer) and indicates the sequence for stages ``alpha``, ``beta`` and ``rc``. For
   the ``final`` stage, suffix has to be zero. If stage is set to ``alpha`` and the suffix is zero, this has a
   special meaning (development version, designated with a ``.devN`` suffix). For ``beta`` and ``rc`` stages,
   suffix must be greater than zero (minimum 1).


Release Process
---------------

Once all feature branches selected for a specific release are finalized and merged back in ``origin/master``, the
release process can start.

Stage 1: Code Slush
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first phase of a release publishing cycle starts with a code slush. Under code slush, ``origin/master`` is not hard
protected against any change, but stabilization PRs (i. e. bug fixes, quality improvements) will get a higher priority.
The priority order expressed in PR classes:

1. *qca* (bug fixes, quality improvements)
2. *doc* (documentation updates and polishing)
3. *imp* (improvements, enhancements, optimisation)

*new* and *pro* class PRs should be avoided and postponed to after the release has been finalized.

The code slush phase ends with production of the first alpha release.

Stage 2: Code Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second phase begins with the release of the first alpha version. From here on, a strict code freeze is imposed on
``origin/master``. This means no PRs will be accepted and merged unless linked to the upcoming release. Normally, this
means only *qca* class PRs linked to issues related to the upcoming release milestone will be considered.

Under code freeze, alpha and beta versions are tagged in master and released for wider testing.

Stage 3: Pre-Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If maturity in ``origin/master`` is considered sufficient for release, a dedicated
:ref:`release branch <release-branches>` for the release is created (``release/major.minor``). The code freeze on
master persists. From now on, release-related *qca* fixes are to be applied to the release branch. During the
pre-release phase, release candidate releases are tagged in the release branch and published to further mature the
release.

Stage 4: Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As soon as the maturity in the release branch is sufficient for a final release, all pending PRs have to be either
merged or rejected. The head of the release branch has to be tagged with the final release number, and the release
branch has thereafter to be converted into a `protected branch`_.

The release itself has to be created on GitHub using the final release tag as anchor reference.

The release branch has now to be merged back into ``origin/master``, and with a further local PR, the version in
``origin/master`` has to be bumped to the next release cycle (this is no final decision, it can be reverted at a later
stage). This formally lifts the code freeze on ``origin/master`` and allows to proceed with PRs that use a properly
rebased feature branch with most recent changes in ``origin/master``.

Stage 5: Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the release branch is now managed as protected branch, direct commits to this branch are no longer possible.
Instead, if a published release needs fixing, and the fix is well contained so it can be contained as patch and not
as minor or even major release change, the following procedure has to be applied:

A :ref:`hotfix branch <hotfix-branches>` has to be created (outside``origin``), based on the release branch at the
last published version tag. There the necessary amendments can be developed and matured. Once finalized, the hotfix
branch has to be merged back into the release branch via pull request, and subsequently a new patch version has to be
tagged in the release branch, and the new patch release shall be published.

.. important::

   Support for all prior versions from a release branch cedes the moment a new patch version is published.

As a final step after a patch has been published, the fix needs to be introduced to ``origin/master`` if still
applicable there (e. g. an intermediate architectural change could have removed entirely the concerned code from
``origin/master``). If still applicable, the method of injection has to be chosen on how far ``origin/master`` has
diverted from the (now patched) release branch.

If both branches are still closely enough together, a pull request would be the preferred technique to merge the
changes into ``origin/master``. If however both branches have diverted significantly (e. g. due to long-term support),
other techniques such as cherry-picking the patch commit or even a "manual" injection via a dedicated feature branch
might be the appropriate solution.

.. hint::

   While bringing a fix back into ``origin/master`` is mandatory, the choice of technique to accomplish this is
   subject to common sense of the :ref:`core team <core-team>`, as it is nearly impossible to anticipate any
   combination of factors that might arise in the future around that subject.
